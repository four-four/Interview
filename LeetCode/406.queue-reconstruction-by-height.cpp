 * Testcase Example:  '[[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]'
 *
 * Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is
 * described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person
 * and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height
 * greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
 * 
 * Note:
 * The number of people is less than 1,100.
 * 
 * 
 * Example
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
 * 
 * Output:
 * [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
